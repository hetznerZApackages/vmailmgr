The CDB library was originally written by D.J.Bernstein <djb@pobox.com>.
I have subsequently rewritten parts of it to better fit into C++ style

package says:

	If you want to incorporate cdb into your own packages, you can
	just copy the code here.

The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm library was written by Ulrich Drepper
<drepper@gnu.ai.mit.edu>, 1995, and was taken from the GNU C Library
