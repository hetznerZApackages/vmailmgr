  You will need a working C and C++ compiler and linker. You will not
  need any C++ libraries.  The package is being developed under Linux
  using egcs and glibc version 2, and may rely on some gcc/g++
  extensions.

  This package should work without changes both with and without shadow
  passwords as long as the shadow password libraries are present when
  this package is built. The `configure' script will detect what method
  of shadow passwords are being used and the programs will be built
  accordingly.

  Yes, vmailmgr supports Courier-IMAP.  Some minor steps are needed to
  make them work, the steps are in the next section of this file.

  VMailMgr is based around qmail's handling of virtual users, and as
  such requires qmail for its operation. If you wish to use the `init'
  file to start/stop vmailmgrd or are installing the RPM package,
  supervise-scripts version 2.2 (or later, available at
  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/supervise-scripts/>) and daemontools 0.60 (or
  later, available at  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/rpms/daemontools/>)
  packages are required.  If you need to use the vmailmgrd daemon, you
  will also need the unixserver program, from the ucspi-unix package,
  available at  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/ucspi-unix/>.

  If you want to use the autoresponse feature, I recommend the use of my
  own autoresponder program, qmail-autoresponder available at
  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/qmail-autoresponder/>.

  Output from vmailmgrd can be recorded by either splogger (part of
  qmail) or with the logger that comes with several flavours of UNIX. To
  use splogger, pipe the output of vmailmgrd into the command `splogger
  vmailmgrd'. This will timestamp each entry and tag them with the word
  `vmailmgrd'. By default, splogger logs to facility 2 (mail). To use
  logger, pipe the output of vmailmgrd into the comamand `logger -t
  vmailmgrd -p mail.notice'. See the respective man pages of these two
  programs for more information.

  Note: The use of syslog for logging messages is strongly discouraged
  due to problems with inefficent and buggy implementation of syslog.

  Make a directory into which the output will go, for example
  `/var/log/vmailmgrd'. Pipe the output of vmailmgrd into the command
  `multilog t /var/log/vmailmgrd'. See the documentation for multilog
  for more information on how to adjust its output.

  VMailMgr supports Courier-IMAP, but Courier-IMAP does not auto detect
  VMailMgr.  This means that some minor work is required for making the
  two work together.

  +o  You must copy `/usr/local/bin/authvmailmgr` to `/usr/lib/courier-
     imap/libexec/authlib/authvmailmgr`.

  +o  Then modify the `AUTHMODULES` statement in `/usr/lib/courier-
     imap/etc/imapd.config` and add `authvmailmgr` as the first
     authentication module.

  If you are upgrading from an older version, you may need to make some
  changes to your system before or after doing the upgrade. The
  following table outlines the necessary changes. Note that you need to
  follow the instructions for all later versions of the software.

  If you are upgrading from version:

     00..9966..66 oorr eeaarrlliieerr
        The `vmailmgrd' daemon needs to be run by unixserver, as opposed
        to being a stand-alone program previously.

     00..9966..22 oorr eeaarrlliieerr
        Make sure the `vmailmgrd' daemon and vmailmgr CGIs are disabled
        before upgrading, and upgrade them along with the main package.
        Changes were made to the daemon interface that will cause adding
        users and aliases to flake out. As well, the listdomain
        interface was completely redone.


     00..9944 oorr eeaarrlliieerr,, uussiinngg tthhee PPOOPP bbuulllleettiinn ffaacciilliittyy
        The POP bulletin facility has been moved into a stand-alone
        program that needs to be executed through `checkvpw-postsetuid'.


     00..9933 oorr eeaarrlliieerr
        If you do not use the CGIs, you no longer need to run the
        `vmailmgrd' daemon.


     00..9922..22 oorr eeaarrlliieerr
        The configuration changed from reading a single file to reading
        a set of files in a directory. Read the configuration
        documentation and run the program `vconf2dir'.


     00..9900..22 oorr eeaarrlliieerr
        The name of the user to which mail to an unknown user is
        delivered changed from `*' to `+'. If you were using this
        feature, either change all your domains to accomodate this
        change, or set the `default-username' config file to contain
        `*'.


     00..8888 oorr eeaarrlliieerr
        The file format of the virtual password tables has changed from
        plain text files to CDB tables. You will need to suspend local
        deliveries before upgrading, and run the program `vpasswd2cdb'
        as each base user after upgrading, before re-enabling local
        deliveries.

  `/etc/rc.d/init.d/pop3d restart'.

  There are two ways to log in without using multiple IP addresses.

  The first way is to log in as `userSEPvirtual.domain.org', where
  `user' is the mailbox name of the virtual user, SEP is one of `@' or
  `:' (by default, this is configurable in the `/etc/vmailmgr/'
  directory), and `virtual.domain.org' is the virtual domain's name, as
  listed in `/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains'.

  The second way is to use the internal form of the mailbox name -- that
  is, `baseuser-user', where `user' is the same as above, and `baseuser'
  is the username of the managing user.

  Example: `/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains' contains

    testdomain.org:testuser


  User `testuser' exists, and has set up a virtual mailbox with the name
  `v'. The `separators' variable in `/etc/vmailmgr/' contains `@:'. This
  virtual user could log in as `v@testdomain.org', `v:testdomain.org',
  or `testuser-v'.

  In the `vmailmgr/' configuration directory, there is an entry called
  `default-username'. If mail to a virtual domain does not match any
  users or aliases in that domain, it is delivered to the name listed in
  this configuration item if it exists (which defaults to `+'). To make
  this deliver to you, simply type:

    vaddalias me +

  If vmailmgrd reports `vmailmgrd: bind: no such file or directory' when
  you start it up, it means that can't create its socket file.  By
  default, it will try to create the socket file `/tmp/.vmailmgrd'. You
  must ensure that `/tmp' is writable, or that the socket is created in
  some other place by setting `socket-file' in the configuration.

  If qmail reports "deferral: vdeliver: qmail-queue exited with an
  error!", check where your qmail is installed.  On Debian systems, you
  will need to type "ls -s /usr/sbin /var/qmail/bin", since they've
  installed the qmail binaries into /usr/sbin.

  When run by itself, vmailmgrd will report "Timed out waiting for
  remote".  vmailmgrd needs to be run from unixserver, part of the
  ucspi-unix package available at  <http://em.ca/~bruceg/ucspi-unix/>.

  Yes, they are available through anonymous CVS.  To access the CVS
  server, set your CVSROOT to :pserver:cvs@bruce-
  guenter.dyndns.org:/CVS, log in with an empty password, and check out
  the vmailmgr module.

  Incoming email is first received by the qmail SMTP daemon and inserted
  into the qmail queue. Then `qmail-send' examines the email envelope
  (which details the recipient address or addresses) to determine how to
  dispatch the message. It looks up the domain name of each recipient in
  `/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains', and prefixes the user name with
  the string that it finds. It then looks up the resulting user name in
  the system password table (or in `/var/qmail/users/cdb' if it exists)
  to find the base user name and home directory (which I will call
  `$HOME'). It then looks for the file `$HOME/.qmail-VIRTUAL'. If that's
  not found, it looks for the file `$HOME/.qmail-default', which will
  contain an instruction to pipe the message to `vdeliver'.

  This is where vmailmgr first enters the picture. The virtual user name
  is sent to `vdeliver' through environment variables. It looks in the
  configuration files (in `$HOME/.vmailmgr' and then in `/etc/vmailmgr')
  to determine the location of the password table, and looks up the
  virtual user name in the table to determine delivery instructions. If
  the name is not found, the message is bounced and delivery ends.
  Otherwise, it then looks for the `vdeliver-predeliver' script in the
  configuration directories (in reverse order) and executes any that are
  found. It then delivers the message to all the listed destinations --
  an optional mailbox directory and zero or more forwarding addresses.
  Finally, it looks for the `vdeliver-postdeliver' script and executes
  any that are found.

  Outgoing email is not handled by vmailmgr. For details on outgoing
  email handling, check the qmail documentation.

  The socket used by the daemon is a UNIX-domain socket (as opposed to
  Internet-domain), meaning you need local access on the computer to
  open up a connection.  The path for this socket is run-time
  configurable.

  The daemon forks a new connection for each connection, up to a
  configurable maximum (at which point it stops listening, IIRC, I
  should verify this).  The idea of threading has been completely
  discarded to avoid a bug in a command creeping in and makeing the
  whole server break.

  The protocol spoken over the socket is explicitly bounded to at most
  64kB of data, and all data is prefixed by a size.  Static-sized
  buffers are only used with static-sized reads, and therefore can't be
  overflowed with stack-smashing tricks.

  The daemon commands setuid to the appropriate user as soon as the base
  user has been verified, to avoid doing any more than necessary as
  root, as well as to avoid the possibility of tricking the daemon into
  reading a file another user wouldn't normally have access to.

  To help avoid DoS on the local computer, a 1-second alarm is set as
  soon as the connection is received, and is only cleared once all the
  data has been read.  If it takes longer than 1 second to read the data
  from the socket, the server process exits.
