from_ver1_record public, and moved them into their own modules.

<li>daemon/listdomain.cc (CMD_FD): Changed the protocol to strip the

response (with length and all), and to include full vpwentry
details in each entry rather than requiring seperate lookups.

domain-&gt;lookup.

<li>lib/misc/vpwentry_from.cc (from_record): Turned the if/else
block into a switch statement.

<li>commands/vadduser.cc (set_defaults): Turn off creation of a

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc (dispatch_cmd): Changed handling of commands:
there is now a minimum and a maximum number of arguments, and the

looping will always sleep.  If the file creation failed, it would
previously loop immediately.

<ul>

<li>Released version 0.94

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc: Commented out the "stat" and "statall"

adjusted to fit this model.

programs to handle the changes.

<li>Inserted the latest mystring class and adapted all the code to
handle it.

and moved it all into the vdomain class (was struct).  Adjusted
all other references to use this new code.

<ul>

<li>lib/config/read_*.cc: Moved the overhead for maintaining the
cache into these read functions instead of duplicating it in each
config variable function.

<li>lib/config/build-config.sh: Create a cache for each config
variable in order to eliminate duplicate readings of a single
variable.

<li>daemon/pwentry_table.cc (operator[]): Replaced the previous
implementation (a cache) with one that just calls getpwnam.  This
avoids creating extra dynamic data in the form of many pwentry
structures.

<li>daemon/lookup.cc (lookup_baseuser): Removed an extraneous
re-creation of the pwentry returned from the pwentry_table.

<li>lib/config/read_*.cc: Removed the translation from '_' to '-'
for filenames from the code and moved it into the build-config.sh
script.  This moves the constant conversion from run-time to
build-time.

<li>lib/config/configrc.cc (configuration): Made the constructor
take a pointer instead of a reference, which was probably the
saner thing to do from the start.

<li>lib/config/read_dir.cc (read_dir): Modified the logic here so
that the macros for creating the config reading routines can be
completely uniform.

<li>daemon/state.cc (saved_state): Since the saved state is never
un-saved, don't try to establish what the previous state is with
getuid and getegid.

<li>daemon/state.h: Turned the CHANGE_STATE macro into a no-op,
since the state is already saved when doing any lookup.

<li>daemon/lookup.cc (lookup_baseuser): Set up the saved state
immediately upon successfully doing a base user lookup.

<li>daemon/state.h (class saved_state): Removed the pwentry pointer
and made the domain a non-pointer as well.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-07-17  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/state.cc: Modified these routines to set up a pwentry
before setting up the vdomain, as well as properly restoring the
old config pointer.

<li>commands/*.cc: Replaced all instances of "domain-&gt;" with
"domain.", since "domain" is no longer a pointer.

<li>clients/vdeliver.cc (main): Modified to set up a pwentry before
setting up the vdomain.

<li>clients/checkvpw.cc (set_user): Modified to set up a pwentry
before setting up the vdomain.

<li>commands/vcommand.cc (go_home): Modified to create a global
pwentry named "user", and build the domain and config based on
that.

<li>lib/misc/vdomain.cc (vdomain): Modified the constructors to take
a pwentry parameter to build the domain config from.

<li>lib/misc/pwentry.cc: Moved this file here from daemon, added a
"config" structure entry, and added a default constructor.
(pwfile): Removed the pwfile_cache member, which was a kluge for
what I thought was a bug somewhere else.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-07-15  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Forwarded-ported envelope delivery re-write from 0.92.2 for
clients/vdeliver.cc.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-07-13  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/lookup.cc: Converted is_local and find_virtual to use the
qmail_root config item.

<li>Forwarded-ported logic fix from 0.92.1 for clients/vdeliver.cc.

<li>clients/vdeliver.cc (inject): Use the new qmail_root config item
to locate the qmail-queue binary.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-06-24  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/hash_table.h: Fixed a typo in the hash table prime list
(the last numbers were truncated).

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-06-14  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>doc/FAQ.texi: Added a "troubleshooting" section, to be filled in
as questions arrive.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-06-07  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Modified all the sources to use the new configuration class
members.

<li>commands/vcommand.cc (go_home): Initialize the password_file
global from config-&gt;password_file() here.

<li>lib/config/configrc.cc: Totally re-wrote the configuration
system to use a subdirectory style config, with individual files
containing the configuration values on their first line.  The
configuration modules are also built by a script, and broken down
into individual object modules to reduce the size of programs that
don't use all the options.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-06-05  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/*.cc: Moved the calls to CHANGE_STATE to immediately
after validating the user, to allow the config set up by the
saved_state to be used immediately.

<li>clients/checkvpw.cc (set_user): Set up a vdomain here and set
the config to allow for locally-configured bulletin directories.
(main): Moved the call to set_user higher, to allow the config to
be used earlier to set the error maildir.

<li>clients/vdeliver.cc (main): Set up a vdomain and set the config
to its config, to load a local configuration when doing
deliveries.

<li>daemon/pwentry.cc: Removed the definitions for user_dir_rel and
user_dir_abs, since vdomain::userdir will do the job now (it seems
that user_dir_abs wasn't even used, too).

<li>daemon/state.cc: Moved the constructor and desctuctor for
saved_state into this object, and added a call to push a new
configuration if state was changed successfully.

<li>commands/vcommand.cc: Moved the go_home routine into here, and
added a global "domain" pointer that will point to the current
virtual domain.
(go_home): Push the domain config onto the config stack.  Now all
the command programs will use a local configuration.  This routine
will eventually be rewritten to handle multiple domains in the
same user.

<li>commands/vadduser.cc: Converted to using a vdomain object.

<li>Converted all instances of "config." to "config-&gt;" where
appropriate (the vdomain class has a non-pointer config member, so
it doesn't count).

<li>lib/misc/server.cc: Rewrote call and connect to take as a
parameter the socket filename to use.  server_call::call has a
default argument now of config-&gt;socket_file to prevent having to
change any code, but this might disappear, too.

<li>lib/misc/configrc.cc: Turned the global 'config' item into a
pointer, to allow other code to essentially push down local
configurations onto it.  Wrote config_push and config_pop to
assist with this.

<li>commands/vaddusers.cc (add_one): Make the alias name lower case
before using it, call vuser_adduser with the maildir argument set.

<li>lib/misc/vuser_add.cc (vuser_adduser): Modified this routine to
remove the call to userdir, forcing the maildir name to be created
at a higher level.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-06-04  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/misc/configrc.cc (configuration): Eliminated the #defined
default constants, as they are used only once, and moved them
directly into the default configuration constructor.

<li>lib/misc/configrc.h (class configuration ): Added a "parent"
member item that points to the object from which the defaults for
this configuration was set (set to NULL in the default object).

<li>lib/misc/vdomain.cc: Created this construct to represent a
virtual domain.  Copied the functionality from userdir.cc into
here (with the plan of removing userdir.cc in the future).  This
will become the status-holder for multiple domains within a single
real user.

<li>lib/misc/configrc.cc (configuration): Added a new constructor
that copies the values from a set of defaults and reads in a
config file to override those defaults.  To be used for local
configuration handling.  Relegated the default constructor to only
setting the default values, and added a new global const object
config_defaults to hold these.

<li>commands/*: Added a call to go_home in every cli_main.

<li>commands/go_home.cc (go_home): Wrote this routine to chdir to
the user's HOME directory.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-06-03  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>commands/listvdomain.cc (cli_main): I forgot to check the return
value of start_getpw here, leading to a core dump when the
password table can't be opened.  Fixed.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-06-01  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>commands/vsetup.cc (setup_qmail_default): Changed the mode of
the created .qmail-default file to 0444 (minus umask) instead of
0666 to prevent qmail from complaining on systems where umask
defaults to 002 instead of 022, and to prevent inadvertent editing
of the .qmail-default file.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-05-30  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;

</p>
<p>1999-05-28  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>clients/vdeliver.cc: Rewrote the alias delivery routines to send
the email to qmail-queue instead of qmail-inject, since
qmail-inject will attempt to reformat the message.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-05-27  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/check.cc (CMD): Added a check to ensure that checking the

<li>daemon/addaliasp.cc (CMD): Added this new command to add an
alias with a password.

<li>doc/vmailmgr-cgi.texi: Updated the documentation for vaddalias.
Changed all instances of "necessary" to "required".

<li>cgi/vaddalias.cc (CGI_MAIN ): Now allows for an optional new
password field pair, and calls addaliasp if they are not empty.

<li>lib/misc/server.cc (server_call): Added a new server_call for 5
parameters.

<li>daemon/log.cc (logcommand): Added a new logcommand routine to
handle 5 parameters.

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc: Modified the dispatch entry for addalias.

<li>daemon/chpass.cc (CMD): Removed the custom password checking
since it is now merged into lookup_and_validate.

<li>daemon/chalias.cc (CMD): Call lookup_and_validate with the
"userpass" flag set to true to allow owners of virtual aliases set
up with a password to change their alias.

<li>daemon/lookup.cc (lookup_and_validate): Modified to optionally
do comparisons against the virtual user's password if the
comparison against the administrator's password fails.  Removed
the allowance for empty passwords.  Made all the password
mis-match messages the same.  The admin password check is done
before the virtual user check to avoid giving away information
about virtual users.

<li>commands/vaddalias.cc (cli_main): Set passwords on aliases by
passing in a '-p' or '--password' flag.

<li>lib/misc/vuser_add.cc (vuser_addalias): Modified to allow
passwords on aliases.

"true".

<li>commands/vdelalias.cc, commands/vdeluser.cc,
commands/vaddusers.cc, commands/vaddalias.cc,

<li>commands/vadduser.cc (add_user): Changed to use vuser_set.

<li>lib/misc/vuser_set.cc (vuser_set): Renamed vuser_add to
vuser_set, and moved it into this file.  vuser_set can be used to
change existing entries as well as to add new entries.

<li>commands/vrehash.cc (lock_dir): Set permissions on created CDB
file to 0600.

<li>commands/vpasswd2cdb.cc (cli_main): Set permissions on created
CDB file to 0600.

needed.

<li>clients/bulletins.cc (stat_maildir): Fixed two bugs: timestamp
file was named "maildir/cur/.timestamp" instead of just
"maildir/.timestamp"; timestamp file was opened for writing
without a mode, causing the resulting file to have an
indeterminate mode.

<ul>

<li>lib/misc/md5-crypt.c (md5_crypt_r): This routine depended on the

<li>lib/misc/pwcrypt.cc: Adapted these routines to using the GNU MD5
library and the md5_crypt routine.
(crypt_cmp): Revised the algorithm here to use the old MD5 routine
only for old passcodes, md5_crypt for hashes starting with "$1$",
and crypt otherwise.  This should be compatible with all
implementations.

<li>lib/misc/configrc.cc (read_config): Modified to use fdibuf
instead of ifstream.

<li>lib/pwcrypt.cc (crypt_cmp): Modified to automatically handle MD5
hashed passcodes.
Renamed encrypt to pwcrypt, which calls encrypt_md5 to produce MD5
hashed passcodes.

<li>Completed conversion of source packaging from custom makefiles
to automake.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-02-25  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Released version 0.87

<li>Removed my kludged handling for building shared libraries.  This
greatly simplifies the process of moving to both automake and
libtool.  The executables are somewhat larger, but still come in
under about 25K each (on i386 Linux).

<li>clients/bulletins.cc (scan_bulletins): Skip scanning the local
bulletin directory if the user is non-virtual.

<li>clients/checkvpw.cc (struct user_data): Added a non_virtual flag
to this data, indicating that the user is not a virtual user.
(main): Pass the non_virtual flag into scan_bulletins.

<li>lib/ac-wait.h: Moved the #include ladder that is required to use
wait(2) functions here.

<li>lib/ac-dirent.h: Moved the #include ladder that is required to
use dirent functions here.

<li>lib/ac-time.h: Moved the #include ladder that is required to use
time functions here, and rewrote all the files that include either
&lt;time.h&gt; or &lt;sys/time.h&gt; to instead include "ac-time.h"

<li>commands/vpasswds.cc (cli_main): Removed call to srandom.

<li>commands/vpasswd.cc (cli_main): Removed call to srandom.

<li>commands/vaddusers.cc (cli_main): Removed call to srandom.

<li>commands/vadduser.cc (cli_main): Removed call to srandom.

<li>lib-cli/main.cc (main): Call srandom here to give all the CLI
programs a properly initialized random function automatically.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-02-24  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/main.cc: All signal handlers call signal to re-enable
signal handling on systems that reset signals.

<li>daemon/fork.cc (handle_children): Re-assert the SIGCHLD signal
handler after a signal is received, since some systems will reset
the behavior of signals after they've been received.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-02-22  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib-cgi/cgi-base.cc (main): Eliminated the timezone setup since
it is totally unnecessary.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-02-09  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib-dbi/user.h: Moved the password validation method out of the
ruser/vuser classes into struct passcode.  This class may
eventually be split into multiple classes, one per passcode type.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-02-06  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

</p>
<p>1999-01-28  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

</p>
<p>1999-01-26  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>commands/vadduser.cc: Modified to accept a "directory" argument
of where to put the user's mailbox.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-01-12  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Rewrote various sources to take advantage of new mystring
library constructor functions.

<li>Inserted revised mystring library.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1999-01-09  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Released version 0.85

<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.cc (dirname): Fixed stupid bug -- used
"right" instead of "left" to get the directory part of the
filename.  This bug was introduced by the following change.

<li>All files: reworked code to remove cases where an automatic
conversion from type mystring to "const char*' was expected.
Instead, all the code uses the c_str() function in mystring.

<li>Added a note in the FAQ regarding the default username.

<li>lib-cli/main.cc: Rewrote the CLI library to remove dependance on
the GNU libiberty getopts.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-12-29  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

leading "From " line to false.

<li>Released version 0.84

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-12-25  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/response_read.cc (read): Removed the __GNUG__ cruft here
that was only really necessary to optimize on old "mystring" use
(and probably only added nearly useless complexity even then).

<li>lib/userdir.cc (userdir): Added a work-around for the apparent
egcs inlining bug to fix those core dumps when running vadduser
and friends.  Using egcs -finline-functions causes them to core
dump, without inlining everything works OK.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-12-09  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>commands/vadduser.cc (cli_main): Fixed off-by-one error

buggy and abort if so.

</ul>

<p>1998-12-03  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>configure.in: Modified the tests for -fno-exceptions and
-fno-rtti to actually run the C++ compiler and check its result.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-12-02  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>commands/*.cc: Refitted all the command programs to use lib-cli.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-11-29  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>commands/vaddalias.cc: Refitted to use lib-cli.

<li>lib-cli/main.cc: Wrote a top-level command-line interface
helper, which handles automatic help-screen generation, short and
long argument parsing, and will eventually handle switching
between "standard" command use and server-call usages.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-11-28  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>commands/listvdomain.cc: Wrote this program to list the contents
of a virtual domain.

<li>configure.in: Added a somewhat poor hack to handle support for
static vs shared libraries.

<li>lib/vpwentry_get.cc: added start_getpw, end_getpw, and getpw
routines.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-11-24  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/main.cc: Fixed handling of aborted and timed out
requests.  A timed out request will result in two error messages,
one from the alarm, and one from the failed read.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-11-07  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@hal.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Released version 0.83

<li>doc/vmailmgr-cgi.texi: Added a section to describe the use of
the listvdomain CGI.

<li>cgi/listvdomain.cc (show_dest): Split original show_user into
show_dest which calls show_mbox or show_alias.
(show_mbox): Modified output to show mailbox destination.
(CGI_MAIN ): Accepts form inputs mboxlink and aliaslink, which are
links inserted on each mailbox or alias name, with '%' replaced by
the mailbox or alias name.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-10-29  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/main.cc (handle_connection): It appears that accept may
return with an error if a signal occurred while the accept was
being processed.  So, loop around accept until a valid fd is
returned.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-10-12  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/cgi-*: Moved these files into lib-cgi.

<p>1998-09-29  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/server.cc, lib/response*.cc: Changed all instances of "const
mystring&" to "mystring".

"mystring".

<li>lib/cgi-base.cc: Exported content_type function.
Changed all instances of "const mystring&" to "mystring".

processes and sleep until they are all no longer active.

<li>daemon/daemon.h: Moved parts of this file into command.h and
log.h.

<li>daemon/*.cc: Replaced all instances of "cout" that produce log
messages with "log()" or "log(msg)".

<li>daemon/log.cc (log): Added new routine that prefixes log lines
with "[pid] " if the log is being output from a child process.

<li>cgi/listvdomain.cc (show_domain): Fixed loop logic to properly
truncate the buffer when repeating.  Set up the output to display
a table instead of a list.
(show_user): Added this routine to output a single user, doing a
lookup to determine if the name is a mailbox or alias.

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc: Changed all the entries that would modify a
user to be "forked" methods.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-09-23  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/listdomain.cc (CMD): write_buf returns true on success,
not false.  Fixed.

<li>lib/response_message.cc (message): Fixed a minor bug: the "msg"
portion of the response was treated as a NUL-terminated C string
instead of as binary data, causing potential truncation when used
with the listdomain facility.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-09-21  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>clients/checkvpw.cc (authenticate): Modified to handle extra
maildir value in string, eliminating an extra lookup.

<li>daemon/check.cc (CMD): Modified return string to include a
maildir for virtual users.

<li>daemon/fork.cc: Removed all the code that dealt with process
slots to fix a race condition: the forked process could exit
before the parent registers it as a child, causing the active
process counts to become incorrect and eventually prevent any
further forks.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-09-20  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/main.cc (handle_connection): Modified to use new fork
logic.
(usage): Added -v/-V option to usage message.

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc (dispatch_cmd): Fixed logic of "did_fork"
flag to become two flags: needs_write and needs_exit.

<li>daemon/main.cc (main): Removed use of atexit(exit_fn) to
automatically remove the socket file, since it must not be removed
when exiting from a forked routine.

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc (dispatch_cmd): dup2 returns -1, not
non-zero, on error.  Fixed.

<li>doc/vmailmgr.pod: Added the full list of programs that are part
of this package to a "SEE ALSO" list.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-09-12  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>clients/checkvpw.cc (main): Fixed design flaw in the "missing
maildir" design caused by setting the MAILDIR environment variable
before checking for the existance of the maildir.
(find_maildir): Changed search logic -- if no matching string is
found, indicate that the last argument is the "maildir" argument.
(main): Removed several redundant checks that were a result of the
above change.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-09-09  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/response_read.cc (read_response): Fixed the missing "break"
in the switch statement.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-09-08  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/main.cc (handle_intr): Ignore PIPE signals while exiting,
as there is a potential for an infinite loop to occur if stdout is
a pipe that closes before this program exits.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-09-05  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/response_read.cc (receive_string): Moved this routine here
from lib/server.cc.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-08-21  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;

implementation of this CGI.

<li>lib/server.cc (call): Modified to use the new response
constructor to read the response from the client.

<li>lib/response.h (struct response): Added a constructor to read
the data from a file descriptor.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-08-13  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/lookup.cc (lookup_and_validate): Fixed the behavior when
the password table contains a "default" user, the requested user
does not exist, and the "mustexist" flag is set.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-07-31  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>cgi/listvdomain.cc: Started this CGI program to list the users
in a virtualdomain, using the new "listdomain" server function.

<li>lib/server.h (class server_call): Added a routine 'socket' to
return the open socket.

<li>lib/server.cc (call): Modified to record the file descriptor for
the connection and to close it when the server_call is destructed.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-07-26  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc (dispatch_cmd): In the case of a forked
dispatch, move the output to fd #2 (usually stderr), to give it a
constant location.

<li>lib/response.h (struct response): Added the 'maxsize' constant
representing the maximum size of any one transmitted message.

<li>daemon/listdomain.cc (CMD(listdomain)): Completed implementation
of this command.

<p>1998-07-21  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/listdomain.cc (CMD(listdomain)): Started building this

<ul>

<li>daemon/main.cc (parse_options): Added support for a "verbose"
flag.

<li>daemon/fork.cc (do_fork): Wrote this new routine to fork a new
process and record its pid in a table (if slots are available in

that were forked and have exited.

<li>daemon/main.cc (handle_connection): Added support for commands
that cause forked connections.

<li>lib/configrc.h (class configuration ): Added new configuration
variable "max_fork" -- the maximum number of forked processes to
handle.

<li>daemon/main.cc (handle_connection): Modified this routine to
simply close the socket fd and continue if the previous operation
forked (the other "half" of the fork will handle the output).

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc (struct dispatch ): Added a field to this
structure to indicate that the operation needs to fork.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-07-09  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Released version 0.80

<li>clients/checkvpw.cc (getdata): Fixed a longstanding error in
setting the password/stamp fields.  Fortunately, this error had no
impact at all on the data we use, but would have been immediately
visible if we were to try to use the timestamp.

<li>daemon/lookup.cc (lookup_virtuser): Added code to look up a
default user if the lookup of a named user fails.

<li>lib/configrc.h (class configuration ): Added a new configuration
variable "default_username".

cause an infinite loop when delivering to multiple destinations.
(build_command): Moved the appending of the hostname from enqueue
into here, to allow it to be added on each recipient.

<p>1998-06-17  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<p>1998-06-15  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/maildir.cc (make_maildir): Modified this routine to make all
the directories leading up to the named directory.

<li>lib/configrc.h (class configuration ): Added the fields
user_dir_bits and user_dir_slices to support userdir.

<li>lib/vuser_add.cc (vuser_add): Modified an error message to make
it more informative.

<li>daemon/pwentry.cc (user_dir_abs): Modified to use userdir.
(user_dir_rel): Modified to use userdir.

<li>lib/vuser_add.cc (vuser_adduser): Modified to use userdir.

<li>lib/userdir.cc (userdir): Wrote this routine, which produces a
relative user directory name, including a hashed-out path and
subdirectories, from a username.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-06-12  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>clients/checkvpw.cc (main): Added a test to check if the user's
maildir exists and, if not, set the maildir to the configured
"error_maildir" string.

<li>daemon/main.cc (handle_intr): Fixed shutdown logic to handle
both cases: interrupted while handing a connection, or while
waiting for a connection.

<li>lib/configrc.h (class configuration ): Added new configuration
variable "error_maildir", which is a read-only maildir that
contains an error mail message.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-06-11  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/configrc.cc (configuration): Commented out the code to read
a local configuration file.

<li>lib/configrc.h: Moved the DEFAULT_* definitions out of here and
into configrc.cc again.

<li>Backed out all the vdomain and configuration patches, in order
to fix all the confusion I had been generating.

<li>daemon/main.cc (main): Changed the "interrupt" logic to exit
after the current request instead of potentially exiting during
the request (and leaving files in a indeterminate state).

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-06-09  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/vdomain.h (struct vdomain): Added a "config" item to this

<p>1998-06-07  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/state.h (class saved_state): Added code to effectively
push/pop a local configuration when entering a saved_state.

<li>*/*.cc: Changed the use of the "config" variable to account for
it being a pointer.

<li>commands/*.cc: Added the line "config = local_config();" to the
main routine before anything else is executed.

<li>lib/configrc.cc (local_config): Added this routine to create a
local configuration based on the given home directory.

<li>lib/configrc.h: Moved the DEFAULT_* definitions out of here and
into configrc.cc (the only place they are referenced).
Modified the constructors to support "stacking" of configurations.
Made the global "config" variable into a pointer to allow it to
change.

<li>daemon/vdomain.h (struct vdomain): Wrote this new structure to
encapsulate a virtual domain.  These domains are stored in a hash
table "vdomains", indexed by base directory.

<li>daemon/chpass.cc, daemon/lookup.cc: Adjusted to use the new
vdomains global.

<li>daemon/pwentry.h (struct pwentry): Removed the vpwentry_cache
from this structure.  This will eliminate the expensive lookups at
startup (the file "passwd" is looked up for each real user) and a
significant amount of memory overhead.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-06-05  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;

<li>daemon/pwentry_cache.cc: Modified the reader to make only a
single pass through the password and shadow password files.

conflicts with the autoconf/configure-generated config.h.

<li>various: Fixups mandated by the use of autoconf.

existant but non-readable original password file.

<li>lib/vuser_add.cc (vuser_add): Changed the order of creating the
maildir and adding the user to the passwd file.  This allows the
maildir to be erased if adding the user fails, since the newly
created maildir is guaranteed to be empty.

<li>lib/maildir.cc (make_maildir): Modified the code to remove any
newly-created directories if creation of any directory fails.

<li>lib/passwdfn.cc (getpasswd_stdin): Changed use of "gets" to
"cin.get".

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-05-26  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>lib/passwdfn.cc (getpasswd_*): Print a warning if the password
is longer than 8 characters.

<li>commands/vpasswds.cc: Wrote this new program to change the
passwords of a list of users.  The input for this list is taken
from standard input and is of the form "name password".  Anything

<li>lib/config.cc: Added a new configuration item: postmaster.

<li>commands/vadduser.cc (main): Removed the call to setup.

<li>commands/vaddusers.cc (main): Removed the call to setup.

<li>commands/vsetup.cc: Wrote this program to set up a new virtual
domain with the proper ".qmail-default" file and a users
directory, along with some useful system aliases.

<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.cc (write): Use "rename" system call.

<li>lib/vpwentry_putpw.cc (putpw): Use "rename" sytem call.

<li>lib/vpwentry_delpw.cc (delpw): Use "rename" system call instead
of "unlink/link/unlink" combination to guarantee atomicity of the
operation.

<li>commands/_setup.cc (setup): Moved this routine out of
vadduser.cc so that it could be shared with vaddusers.cc.  It
should probably go into the shared library under a different
name.

<li>commands/vaddusers.cc: Wrote this new program that adds a list
of users.  The input for this list is taken from standard input
and is of the form "name password [alias ...]".

<li>lib/vpwentry_putpw.cc (putpw): Fixed a bug in the logic that
prevented the temporary password file from being renamed to a
non-existant original file.

<ul>

<li>Released version 0.77

<li>lib/vpwentry_putpw.cc (putpw): Fixed bug that would cause a
failed addition to leave behind a temporary file as well as merged
the case if the file does not already exist.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-05-24  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/pwentry_cache.cc: Fixed this code to deal with shadow
passwords.  Thanks to Andrew Gillespie for the initial patch to
show the problems.  The new code properly deals with caching both
the contents of /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd, as well as handling
the case where shadow passwords don't exist.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-05-22  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Released version 0.76

<li>daemon/file_cache.h (write_file): Call force_valid to avoid
having to re-read the cached table immediately after having
written its contents.  Do this _before_ unlocking the directory to
avoid a race condition.

<li>daemon/file_cache.cc (force_valid): Added this routine to force
the cache state to indicate that the file is valid (if the file is
present).

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-05-15  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;

<p>1998-05-12  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.cc (operator): Modified code to delete

<li>daemon/chpass.cc (CMD): Removed the calls to begin/end_modify.

<li>daemon/file_cache.h (file_cache_writer::write_file): Removed the
begin/end_modify routines and bundled them into this routine.

<p>1998-05-11  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.cc (unlock): Fixed bug in unlocking the

the password table instead of the vuser_chpass routine.

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-05-08  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>Released version 0.75

<li>daemon/main.cc (TIMEOUT): Changed the connection timeout to one
second, as values larger than that are useful only for debugging
the connection handling code.

<li>lib/vpwentry_putpw.cc (putpw): Modified to use '\n' instead of
the endl operator to mark line ends.

<li>lib/vpwentry_delpw.cc (delpw): Modified to use '\n' instead of
the endl operator to mark line ends (allows the output stream to
properly buffer writes).

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-05-07  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>clients/checkvpw.cc, clients/vdeliver.cc: Moved these to files
from "commands" to the "clients" subdirectory

<li>daemon/pwentry_cache.cc (operator): Convert the user names to
lowercase before inserting.

<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.cc (operator): Fixed bug: make the
virtual users' names lowercase before inserting into the table.

<li>daemon/check.cc (CMD): Fixed bug: initialize virtpw pointer.

<li>daemon/lookup.cc (lookup_maildir): Removed obsolete routine.
(CMD): Fixed bug: must initialize the pointers that previously
used autodelete.

<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.cc (operator): Fixed a bug that caused the
password and destination strings to be both stored in the password
field.

<li>daemon/file_cache.cc (validate_cache): Check both the last
modification time on the file and the inode number to determine if
the file has changed.

<li>daemon/*.cc: Changed all variables of type "autodelete&lt;vpwentry&gt;"
back to type "vpwentry*".

vpwtable cache in the pwentry.

<li>daemon/pwentry.cc (pwentry): Initialize the vpwtable on
creation.

<li>daemon/pwentry.h (struct pwentry): Added a vpwentry_cache to
this object.

<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.cc (write): Changed the end-of-line marker
from endl to "\n", as endl will cause the buffer to be flushed.

<li>daemon/main.cc (read_data): Removed support for protocol one
requests (which allows me to remove one more read syscall from the
fast path, shrinking it down to a total of two reads).

</ul>
</p>
<p>1998-05-06  Bruce Guenter  &lt;bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca&gt;
<ul>

<li>daemon/main.cc (read_data): Modified to read messages using
either protocol one or two.

<li>lib/server.cc (build_msg): Modified to build messages using
protocol 2.

<li>daemon/qmail.*: Removed these obsolete source files.

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc (find_virtual): Wrote this routine that
mimics the old behavior of find_virtual from qmail.cc to find a
mapping from a virtual domain name to a prefix, using a map_cache
on control/virtualdomains.

<li>daemon/file_cache.h (class file_cache): Modified the behavior to
automatically load the cache on construction, instead of waiting.

<li>daemon/map_cache.h: Wrote the classes for map_cache, a generic
qmail-style map-file cache (the key and value pair is separated by
a colon, one per line).

<li>daemon/list_cache.h: Renamed locals_cache to list_cache, as a
generic list-file cache class.

<li>daemon/dispatch.cc (is_local): Fixed to check the cached result.

<li>daemon/file_cache.cc: Moved the actual code for file_cache_base
here.

<li>daemon/file_cache.h (class file_cache_base): Created this class
to contain the common code in the file_cache template.

<li>daemon/lookup.cc (lookup_baseuser): fixed the lookup to only
read the cached "pwentries" object once per invocation, and to
check the result.

<li>daemon/qmail.cc (is_local): Removed this routine, as its
functionality can be duplicated with a locals cache.

<li>daemon/locals_cache.cc: Wrote this object to cache the "locals"
table used by qmail to determine what domains are "local".

<li>daemon/qmail.cc: Moved this object here from lib.

<li>daemon/*.cc: Changed all variables of type "autodelete&lt;pwentry&gt;"
back to type "pwentry*", as the lookup functions that would set
these variables now return non-deletable references.

<li>daemon/lookup.cc: Modified the various lookup routines that look
up base users to use the pwentries cache.

<li>daemon/file_cache.h:
<li>daemon/hash_table.h:
<li>daemon/crc32.h:
<li>daemon/crc32.cc:
<li>daemon/crc_hash.h:
<li>daemon/pwentry_cache.cc:
<li>daemon/pwentry_cache.h:
<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.cc:
<li>daemon/vpwentry_cache.h: Merged from temporary development
tree.  Current functionality consists of a generic hash table,
mapping from mystring keys to generic objects; a file cache that
will automatically reload a cached object only when necessary; and
specific code for building caches of the base user password table
(pwentry_cache) and virtual password tables (vpwentry_cache).

<li>lib/vpwentry_putpw.cc (putpw): Now opens the temporary file with
"noreplace" to avoid races, and mode 0700.

<li>lib/vpwentry_delpw.cc (delpw): Now opens the temporary file with
"noreplace" to avoid races, and mode 0700.

operating as the given user.

<li>daemon/lookup.cc (lookup_and_validate): Modified to optionally
create a new vpwentry if the named virtual shouldn't and doesn't
exist yet.

<li>lib/vuser_add.cc (vuser_add): Use validate routines instead of
hard-coded checks.
(vuser_adduser): Renamed the simple vuser_add to vuser_adduser to
avoid confusion between the two vuser_add routines.

<li>lib/validate.cc (validate_username): Wrote this routine to
ensure that a username is valid; returns true if so.

<li>daemon/delalias.cc (CMD(delalias)): Switched from userlookup to

item instead of just '@'.

<li>lib/config.cc (read_config): Added a new configuration option,
"separators", which lists valid separators between the user name

(pwentry::user_dir): Returns the user directory for the given base
user.

<li>lib/config.cc (post_process): Wrote this routine to "tidy up"
some of the configuration strings, such as directories that should
always have a trailing slash ('/').

<li>lib/config.h: Change all the defined configuration macros
(except for DO_SHADOW) to their configuration variables.

addalias.

<li>daemon/delalias.cc (CMD(delalias)): Wrote this routine to delete
an alias.

<li>daemon/addalias.cc (CMD(addalias)): Wrote this routine to add an
alias.

<li>cgi: Merged in all the code and libraries for CGI programs into
the standard build.  At this point, there is a basic framework
that all CGI programs will use, which includes a mechanism that
automatically pulls the inputs from a POST form, and a base class
that is executed on startup.  The CGI module defines the routine
CGI_MAIN, which is executed by the program startup code.  The CGI
module should call either error() or success() at the end of its
execution, which will handle printing out an appropriate message.
All of the v* programs (vpasswd, vadduser, vdeluser, vaddalias,
and vdelalias) have a CGI equivalent.

<li>daemon/deluser.cc (CMD(deluser)): Wrote this routine to delete a
user.

socket to be created without other-write permission when launched
with a non-zero umask.
