checkvpw - check passwords for virtual and non-virtual users

<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
This program is a drop-in replacement for the standard checkpassword,
written by D. J. Bernstein (<A
HREF="mailto:djb@pobox.com">djb@pobox.com</A>) In the absence of virtual
hosting (determined by the use of
<EM>/var/qmail/control/virtualdomainss</EM> and IP aliases), it behaves identically to checkpassword. When virtual
hosting is used, it permits logins from a unique set of users for each of
the aliases.

<P>
<EM>checkvpw</EM> must be run from either the <EM>tcp-env</EM> program (part of the <EM>qmail</EM>
package) or from a suitable substitute, such as <EM>tcpserver</EM>
(part of the <EM>ucspi-tcp</EM> package). These packages are used to determine to which address a remote
host is connecting.
<EM>checkvpw</EM> must also be passed the checkpassword-compatible authentication data on
file descriptor three. This can be accomplished by running it from a tool
such as
<EM>qmail-popup</EM>.

<P>
<EM>checkvpw</EM> accepts a command line in the following format:

<P>
<PRE>        checkvpw [subprogram] [arguments...]
</PRE>
<P>
If the authentication information is valid, the subprogram is run,
otherwise <EM>checkvpw</EM> returns an error to the program that invokes it.

<P>
If the user name contains the character <CODE>@</CODE>, the host name reported by <EM>tcp-env</EM> is replaced by the string following the
<CODE>@</CODE>, and the user name is replaced by the string preceding the
<CODE>@</CODE>. If the local host name reported by <EM>tcp-env</EM> matches one of those in <EM>/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains</EM>, <EM>checkvpw</EM> prepends the
<EM>prepend</EM> string associated with the host name to the given user name. Wildcards in <EM>virtualdomains</EM> are permitted and are handled in the same way <EM>qmail</EM> handles them (see <EM>qmail-send</EM>). For example, if the line <CODE>.bar.com:bar</CODE> appears in the virtual hosts file, it matches <CODE>one.two.bar.com</CODE> but not <CODE>bar.com</CODE>.

<P>
If the user name resulting from the above step appears in the system
password file (typically <EM>/etc/passwd</EM>), the user is treated as a local user and authenticated with the
information from that file. If this authentication succeeds, the mail
directory is set to the subdirectory named on the command line. If the user
name does not appear in the system password file and is of the form <CODE>name-ext</CODE> where <CODE>name</CODE> does appear in the password file, the user is treated as a ``virtual'' user
and authenticated with the information from a file named <EM>passwd</EM> in the user's home directory. If this authentication succeeds, the mail
directory is set to the subdirectory <EM>users/ext/</EM> in the user's home directory, where
<CODE>ext</CODE> is from the above step.

<P>
<EM>checkvpw</EM> also does some rewriting on the arguments of the subprogram. Any argument
matching the string ``<CODE>maildir</CODE>'' (ignoring case) is replaced with the full path of the mail directory, as
determined by the steps above.

<P>
This program may be invoked in combination with <EM>qmail-popup</EM> and
<EM>qmail-pop3d</EM> from inetd by placing the following line in the
<EM>/etc/inetd.conf</EM> configuration file (all one line):

<P>
<PRE>        pop-3 stream tcp nowait root /var/qmail/bin/tcp-env tcp-env -R /var/qmail/bin/qmail-popup &lt;hostname&gt; /usr/bin/checkvpw /var/qmail/bin/qmail-pop3d Maildir/
</PRE>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="RETURN_VALUE">RETURN VALUE</A></H1>
<P>
0 if the user is successfully authenticated, nonzero if any error occurred.
Exit code 1 indicates that a bad password was given, 2 indicates that the
program was used incorrectly, and 111 indicates a temporary failure.

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</A></H1>
<P>
<EM>checkvpw</EM> requires that <CODE>TCPLOCALHOST</CODE> be set to the host name of the local address of the connection.
