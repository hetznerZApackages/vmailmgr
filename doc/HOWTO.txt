  VMailMgr (short for Virtual MAIL ManaGeR) is a package of programs
  designed to manage multiple domains of mail addresses and mailboxes on
  a single host. It co-operates with qmail for mail delivery and program
  control.

  VMailMgr is:

  A series of utilities for managing virtual domains which include a
  password checking interface for qmail which replaces the usual
  checkpassword, and an authentication module for Courier IMAP, that
  provide access to the virtual mailboxes by one of three methods:

  +o  IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user)

  +o  username-based access (username-virtualuser)

  +o  hostname-based access (virtualuser@virtual.host or
     virtualuser:virtual.host)

  You should use it if you prefer to have each domain controlled by a
  seperate username, allowing the use of system quotas and better
  security

  Thanks to Mike Bell, who always seems to have the answers to my
  questions. Finally, thanks to all those on the vmailmgr@lists.em.ca
  <mailto:vmailmgr@lists.em.ca> mailing list who have helped me, or
  asked the same stuff so many times that I had to write this to stop
  the repeat questions.

  Visit the VMailMgr website  <http://www.vmailmgr.org/> to get the
  package.

  If you get the binary RPMS you will need at least the vmailmgr
  package.

  Simply compile the src.rpm file with the `rpm --rebuild` command.
  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm -ivh vmailmgr-0.96.8-1.src.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________

  After compiling the source rpms, the binaries will be located in
  `/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/` or something similar.

  Simply run the following command for each package

    rpm -ivh <location>/<package.i386.rpm>


  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/vmailmgr-0.96.8-1.i386.rpm
    rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/vmailmgr-daemon-0.96.8-1.i386.rpm
  ______________________________________________________________________

  If you dont ue RPMS you can install from source.

  Run the following command

    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf <package.tar.gz>
    cd <newly created dir>
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make install


  -Example-

  ______________________________________________________________________
    (As non-root user)
    tar zxf vmailmgr-0.96.8.tar.gz
    cd vmailmgr-0.96.8
    ./configure
    make
    (As root)
    make install
  ______________________________________________________________________


  That should do it.

  The following steps are necessary to set up a virtual domain with
  vmailmgr (assuming vmailmgr has been compiled and installed). As an
  example, we'll set up a virtual user `me@mydomain.org`, with aliases
  of `myself@mydomain.org` and `myname@mydomain.org`.

  1. Set up a DNS entry for the domain. This is not covered here, as it
     is dependant on far too many other things.  I will mention that to
     make IP based virtual domains work a PTR record which matches an
     entry in virtualdomains is nessesary, for example, if nslookup
     10.56.33.122 returns mail.mydomain.com, `virtualdomains` needs an
     entry like `mail.mydomain.com:myuser' For the example, we'll assume
     that the mail exchanger for mydomain.org is already set up to point
     to your computer.

  2. Set up a base user for the domain. Create a user, with a name of
     your choosing.  Since the maildirs for all the users in the virtual
     domain will be stored under this user's home directory, make sure
     you set the user up in a partition or disk that is appropriate for
     such storage. The tools that you should use to accomplish this step
     vary greatly between different systems. For our example, I'll add a
     user `myuser`.

  3. Configure qmail to recognize the domain. To do this, you need to
     modify two of qmail's configuration files in `/var/qmail/control`
     `rcpthosts` and `virtualdomains`.

  +o  To `rcpthosts` : add the line `mydomain.org`.

  +o  To `virtualdomains` : add the line `mydomain.org:myuser`.

     If you wish to have mail to `anything.mydomain.org` be delivered in
     the same way, add the following

  +o  To `rcpthosts` : add the line `.mydomain.org`.

  +o  To `virtualdomains` : add the line `.mydomain.org:myuser`.

  4. Configure qmail-popup/qmail-pop3d to use `checkvpw` as the password
     checker. This step is dependant on how you have installed qmail.

  +o  Replace `checkpassword` in the command you use to invoke qmail-
     popup/qmail-pop3d (either in `/etc/inet.conf` or in a `tcpserver`
     command) with `checkvpw`.

  +o  And/Or at the prompt type: `echo checkvpw >
     /var/qmail/control/checkpassword`

  5. Set up the vmailmgr files:

  +o  Either change user to the user you just created (for example, type
     `su - myuser`) or log in (with either telnet or at the console) as
     the new user.

  +o  Set up the base vmailmgr files by running `vsetup`.

  +o  Use the included programs to add users and aliases.  For our
     example, we would

  +o  type: `vadduser me` (which prompts for a password)

  +o  type: `vaddalias me myself`

  +o  and type: `vaddalias me myname`

     After you have completed all these steps, you will need to kill and
     restart `qmail-send` to make it read the new `virtualdomains`
     table.

  If you are using `inetd` to launch `qmail-popup`, `kill -HUP` the
  `inetd` process as well.

  There are two ways to log in without using multiple IP addresses.


  1. The first way is to log in as `userSEPvirtual.domain.org`, where
     `user` is the mailbox name of the virtual user, SEP is one of `@`
     or `:` (by default, this is configurable in the `/etc/vmailmgr/'
     directory), and `virtual.domain.org' is the virtual domain's name,
     as listed in `/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains'.

  2. The second way is to use the internal form of the mailbox name --
     that is, `baseuser-user', where `user' is the same as above, and
     `baseuser' is the username of the managing user.

     Example: `/var/qmail/control/virtualdomains' contains

       testdomain.org:testuser


  User `myuser' exists, and has set up a virtual mailbox with the name
  `me'. The `separators' variable in `/etc/vmailmgr/' contains `@:'.
  This virtual user could log in as `me@mydomain.com', `me:mydomain.cm',
  or `myuser-me'.

  In the `vmailmgr/' configuration directory, there is an entry called
  `default-username'. If mail to a virtual domain does not match any
  users or aliases in that domain, it is delivered to the name listed in
  this configuration item if it exists (which defaults to `+'). To make
  this deliver to you, simply type:

    vaddalias me +

  VMailMgr supports Courier-IMAP, but Courier-IMAP does not come with an
  authentication module for VMailMgr.  This means that some minor work
  is required for making the two work together.

  +o  You must copy `/usr/local/bin/authvmailmgr` to `/usr/lib/courier-
     imap/libexec/authlib/authvmailmgr`.

  +o  Then modify the `AUTHMODULES` statement in `/usr/lib/courier-
     imap/etc/imapd.config` and add `authvmailmgr` as the first
     authentication module.
